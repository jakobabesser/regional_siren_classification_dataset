## Description

This dataset includes 270 annotated segments with emergency vehicle siren sounds from
- 9 countries (USA, Canada, Franca, Spain, Italy, Germany, India, China, and Japan)
- 3 siren types (ambulance, firefighters, police)

Naturally, for some countries (e.g., Germany), the same siren sounds are used across siren types.

## Dataset

Due to copyright constraints, we cannot publish the audio files but instead we provide
- [dataset.csv](data/dataset.csv) - a CSV file with Youtube URL and segment times and country and siren type annotation
